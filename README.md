# Dogs-Social-Media

Welcome to **Dogs**, a social network built using React, where users can share their photos and interact with other members. This project was built based on a React course, but several modifications were applied to add new features and improve the user experience.

## Features

### 🛠️ Main Features

- **🚀 Secure Login with Token**: The login system uses a Token generated by the API, ensuring user security. It also includes error handling and an option to reset the password.
- **🛡️ Login Verification**: To provide a continuous and uninterrupted experience, the application checks whether the user is logged in before allowing access to certain pages.
- **📚 Analysis with Graphs**: Implementation of the external library 'Victory' to generate graphs that help in the analysis of user activities.
- **🔗 Intuitive Navigation**: Use of React Router for fluid routing between application pages, providing intuitive navigation.
- **🎨 Account Creation**: Account creation process integrated with the API, with automatic redirection to the login page after registration.
- **🔄 Real-Time Integration**: Users can add and remove photos or comments in real time, with instant interface updates.
- **🔄 Infinite Scroll**: For a seamless user experience, infinite scroll has been implemented, loading new posts as the user navigates the page.

### 📸 AI Generated Images

The images displayed in the application were generated by artificial intelligence. By default, the splash images on the main page are different each time the user logs in. This art style was mainly used for demonstration purposes. Every image uploaded by the user is automatically deleted after 10 minutes, ensuring data privacy and security.
